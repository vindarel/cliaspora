* Cliaspora - Lisp bindings to the Diaspora social network

Diaspora doesn't have a proper API yet.

We need to get  a random page, extract its csrf  token from it, login,
handle cookies and then use json endpoints:

- stream.json
- activity.json
- notifications.json
- more ?


** Use

ยก in development !

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
;; you can put those in ~/.sbclrc
(in-package :cliaspora)
(setf *username* "name")
(setf *password* "pwd")

(login)
(get-stream)
#+END_SRC
